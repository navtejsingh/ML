Machine Learning Algorithms
===========================

Python/Numpy implementation of Andrew Ng's excellent machine learning assignments. Most of the code is direct implementation
of Matlab/Octave code. I have used Numpy vectorization wherever possible. Check out Coursera webpage 
https://www.coursera.org/course/ml for more details.
